Description
-----------

Distributed systems are hard to design, implement, and maintain. Often, systems of this kind are at the heart of your business, and as such, keeping them running is critical for the business to be kept afloat. My team at Talkdesk developed and maintained one such system in the last year and things got quite bumpy sometimes. This talk covers the best practices that help guarantee your critical system is production-ready.

Extra Information
-----------------

Given my company's peers' interest in this talk's topic, I covered it on a [blog post](https://engineering.talkdesk.com/getting-critical-systems-production-ready-an-overview-ac86f6fa7245), in order to share it with a broader audience. I decided to make a talk out of it in the interest of sharing these practices even more with the surrounding ecosystem of engineers, as there are probably many teams out there deploying critical systems in similar clustered environments, especially with the rise of cloud-based infrastructure and kubernetes.
